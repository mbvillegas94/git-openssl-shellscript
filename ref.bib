  abstract  = {Path planning techniques for UGVs has been studied to reach valuable results of performance in avoiding obstacles and recognizing the best path to displace when it is trying to approach from the point A to the B. The path is estimated by computer algorithms that take data from the environment of the UGV in terms of space and depth in function of its actual position. But one problem that must be affronted is to recognize the orientation of the UGV on a specific time. This can be solved by a correctly mathematic modeling of the UGV's cinematic. In this paper we expose a path planning algorithm for an UGV of Ackermann displacement geometry to avoid nearby obstacles using a LIDAR sensor, considering limitations of movement of the UGV cause of its mechanism. The work proposed is to develop a path planning algorithm and simulate it based on the mathematical model of cinematic displacement and considering mechanical constraints of an existing UGV.},
